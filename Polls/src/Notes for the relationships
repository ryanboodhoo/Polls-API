Problems with Bidirectional One-to-Many Mapping:

Tight Coupling: The many-side is tightly coupled to the one-side, reducing flexibility.
Pagination Issues: Loading child entities (e.g., comments) via the parent entity (e.g., post) prevents limiting or paginating results.
Sorting Limitations: Sorting children dynamically is difficult; @OrderColumn can cause performance issues.
LazyInitializationException: Accessing lazily loaded child entities outside the session can lead to errors.
When to Use Bidirectional One-to-Many Mapping:

Suitable when the number of child entities is limited.
Best for tightly coupled relationships where loading child entities alongside the parent is necessary.
Example: Survey App
Question and Options exhibit a one-to-many relationship.
A question has a fixed, small number of options (e.g., 4-5), making bidirectional mapping ideal.
Decision Making:
Choose between bidirectional and unidirectional mappings based on whether the entities are tightly coupled.

Conclusion:

Bidirectional mappings work well for tightly coupled entities with a limited number of children.

Testing Many-to-Many Relationship with Hibernate and Spring Boot
Code Implementation

In JpaManyToManyDemoApplication.java, the run() method tests the many-to-many association between Post and Tag:
Cleans up existing data with deleteAllInBatch() for PostRepository and TagRepository.
Creates a Post and two Tags.
Associates the Post with the Tags (both directions).
Saves the Post, which cascades the save operation to the Tags.
java
Copy code
post.getTags().add(tag1);
post.getTags().add(tag2);
tag1.getPosts().add(post);
tag2.getPosts().add(post);

postRepository.save(post);
Running the Application
Run the application using:

bash
Copy code
mvn spring-boot:run
Hibernate Logs
Observe Hibernate-generated SQL statements in the console:

Cleanup operations: DELETE queries for tables post_tags, posts, and tags.
Insert operations: INSERT queries for posts, tags, and the join table post_tags.
Conclusion

Understanding JPA's @OneToOne Relationship
The @OneToOne annotation defines a one-to-one relationship in JPA. Key attributes include:

fetch = FetchType.LAZY:

Loads the related entity lazily to optimize performance.
The related entity is fetched only when accessed.
cascade = CascadeType.ALL:

Applies all cascading operations (e.g., persist, merge, delete) to the related entity.
Example: Updating or deleting a User entity will update or delete the associated UserProfile.
mappedBy = "user":

Used on the inverse side of a bidirectional relationship.
Tells Hibernate that this entity does not own the relationship. Instead, it should reference the user field in the related entity (e.g., UserProfile).
Bidirectional One-to-One Relationship
Owner of the Relationship: Contains the @JoinColumn annotation to specify the foreign key column.
Inverse Side: Contains the mappedBy attribute to indicate the relationship is managed by the other entity.
Example Setup:

Parent Entity (User): Uses mappedBy on the @OneToOne annotation.
Child Entity (UserProfile): Specifies @JoinColumn to define the foreign key
